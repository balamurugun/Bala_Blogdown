# The Billion (Indian) User Table

This article is an extension to the [The Billion User Table](https://1729.com/the-billion-user-table) written by Jon Stokes.

## Crux of the article

User Details of a platform are safeguarded by each big tech company to preserve their network effect and in turn their valuation. Moving away from platforms is problematic. How to liberate the  users? Put it on a chain like Bitclout.If the Bitclout overtakes user count of other social networks, Social networks will be keen to leverage the bitclout user table.Onchain  user table will be the way forward.

## How can we apply this in Indian Government departments?

Let us take a not so hypothetical example of an Indian user,  moving from a city to  a village to buy a property to settle down as he/she is working remote now.

Let us work backwards counting how  many user tables this user info is stored. 
+ Information about acquiring the land is stored in the revenue department(user table 1). 
+ To register proof of purchase, one must establish their residential proof. Preferred route is to get a proof from the Public distribution department for place of living(user table 2). 
+ What documents are needed to get Public Distribution proof? Aadhar card(12-Digit unique number assigned to Indian citizens)  for each family member(user table 3) along with government utility receipt like gas connection(user table 4). 
+ Ok? Shouldn't getting  the Aadhar card be easy? Yes, of course if you have a birth certificate for your kids from the city corporation(user table 5) with a receipt from the local village administrator(user table 6).

## Solution
Think of the effort and time wasted in traversing all these departments.What could be a good solution? 
+ Putting Aadhar(12-Digit unique number mentioned before) on a chain right at the time of first registration with any government agency. This chain is shared with all government agencies. 
+ Each agency can  authenticate  throughout the life of the user based on his/her consent. 
+ This will reduce a lot of friction on the existing process whether registering a property, buying a vehicle or utilising the government subsidy with a tamper-proof ledge cutting out all the middleman and corruption on the way.
